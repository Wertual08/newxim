# Newxim
Network-on-Chip Simulator. 


This project is dedicated to cycle-accurate NoCs 
simulation and is a part of NoC topologies study
at HSE University. Main 
purpose of the project is to provide tools for 
analyzing NoCs with custom topologies and in 
particular Circulant topologies. There are 
several implemented topologies and potion to 
pecify custom one.
<br>

Project was originally forked from davidepatti/noxim 
but the purpose of modeling NoC\`s with custom 
topologies support led to complete code overhaul. 
As a result, current simulator have support for
different topologies and and routing algorithms.
In addition, overall code structure and performance
were improved along with the number of accumulated 
simulation metrics.
