Network on Chip Simulator

This project is dedicated to cycle-accurate NoCs 
simulation and based on SystemC library. Main 
purpose of the project is to provide tools for 
analyzing NoCs with custom topologies and in 
particular Circulant topologies. There are 
several implemented topologies and potion to 
pecify custom one.

## User manual
Simulation configuration is done with *.yml 
file where parameters can be specified. 
Configuration file is selected via ```-config``` 
command line option (default is config.yml). 
Any parameter specified can be overridden with 
eponymous command line option.
