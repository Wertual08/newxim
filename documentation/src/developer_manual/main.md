# Developer manual



The power of Newxim in it's extencibility, performance and structure.
This section dedicated to description of simulator concepts and code structure.
It also reveals the process of modifications.
Because of requirenment to introduce all modifications via source code, this process can seem challenging.
Example implementations of some algorithms are provided to help with it.
