# Developer manual



The power of Newxim is in it's extencibility, performance and structure.
This section is dedicated to description of simulator concepts and code structure.
It also reveals the process of modifications.
Because of requirenment to introduce all modifications via source code, this process may look complicated.
[Example implementations](modification_guide/main.md) of some algorithms are provided to help understand it`s basics.
