# Basic terms

#### Simulator
Software, which provides tooling for modeling and aggregation of metrics from the network and routing algorithms.

#### Modeling 
Process of communications inside network with preconfigured parameters.

#### Topology 
Graph which describes nodes and links of the network.

#### Routing algorithm
Algorithm for computing next possible destination nodes for the packet without 
taking into consideration current state of the network.

#### Selection strategy 
Algorithm for selecting single destination from the array, provided by routing 
algorithm. It is possible to use current state of the network in selection process.

#### Processor 
Unit which acts as source or destination for each packet.

#### Router 
Operational node of the network used to route the packets.

#### Relay 
Port of the router which must be connected to relay of another router to form link.

#### Topology channel 
Physical links between nodes.

#### Virtual channel 
Virtual link created inside physical link.
