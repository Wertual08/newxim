# Newxim simulator features
Simulator was built to bring maximum extencibility.
Most of it's components can be extended via simple modifications.
Due to performance and simplification reasons, all modifications must be done in source code 
because scripting languages drastically harm simulation time.  
## Built-in features:
- Fully customizable netrowk topology
- A lot of implemented routing algorithms
- Various selection strategies
- Configurable traffic distribution
- Custom simulation parameters
- Expressive configurable metrics
